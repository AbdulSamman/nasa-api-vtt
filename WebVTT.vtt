The Strange Way Fluids Slosh on the International Space Station -

presented by Science@NASA

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.580
The next time you pour yourself a glass of water, 

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.440
pause before you drink it.  

6
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.650
First, swirl the clear liquid around the glass.

7
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.730
Gently slosh it back and forth. 

8
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.630
Tap the glass on the tabletop,

9
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.250
and watch the patterns that form on the surface. 

10
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.160
Now imagine the same exercise ... 

11
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.990
in zero gravity.

12
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.910
Would the waves and ripples look the same? 

13
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.930
Would the liquid slosh more, or less? 

14
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.310
Faster, or slower?

15
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.510
NASA engineers spend a surprising amount of time 

16
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.250
asking themselves these same questions. 

17
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.910
Their interest centers not on water glasses, 

18
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.020
but rather on fuel tanks. 

19
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.210
NASA's most powerful rockets use liquid fuel, 

20
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.920
and when these rockets blast off, 

21
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.920
the propellants slosh around. 

22
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.120
Scientists have a good idea 

23
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.450
how liquids slosh in normal Earth gravity 

24
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.790
where the weight and viscosity of the liquid rule its dynamics. 

25
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.750
Deep space is different, however. 

26
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.500
Weightless propellants are guided by surface tension 

27
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.210
and capillary effects. 

28
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.380
Far from Earth, 

29
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.240
they could slosh and froth in unexpected ways.

30
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.810
'Modern computer models try to predict 

31
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.970
how liquid moves inside a propellant tank,' 

32
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.520
says Brandon Marsell of NASA's Fluid Group 

33
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.790
at the Kennedy Space Center. 

34
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.680
'Most of the models we have 

35
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.160
were validated under 1 g conditions on Earth. 

36
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.270
None have been validated in microgravity.'

37
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.960
Enter the SPHERES-Slosh experiment.

38
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.650
'The International Space Station 

39
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.340
provides the perfect environment 

40
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.260
to conduct liquid behavior studies in microgravity,'

41
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.970
says the principal investigator, 

42
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.170
Paul Schallhorn also at Kennedy. 

43
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.030
'So we have designed an experiment 

44
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.150
that simulates how rocket fuels move around 

45
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.640
inside their tanks.'

46
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.700
Built by Professor Dan Kirk 

47
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.080
and colleagues at the Florida Institute of Technology, 

48
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.100
SPHERES-Slosh is, essentially, 

49
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.010
a fluid chamber grappled by a pair of bowling ball-sized robots. 

50
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.690
The two SPHERES 

51
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.720
(a product of the Space Systems Laboratory at MIT) 

52
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.580
were already onboard the space station 

53
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.860
when the Slosh chamber arrived in February 2014. 

54
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.500
Together. the robots move the chamber back and forth 

55
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.500
to mimic common spacecraft maneuvers 

56
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.020
such as the 'BBQ roll', attitude adjustments, 

57
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.470
and engine shut-downs. 

58
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.130
In 2014, astronauts supervised the robots 

59
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.710
as they made three test runs using chambers 20% 

60
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.740
and 40% filled with fluid-

61
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.350
much like a partially-spent fuel tank.

62
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.720
'We use water 

63
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.420
mixed with a bit of green food coloring,' says Schallhorn.  

64
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.090
Why water? 

65
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.120
'For one thing, 

66
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.900
it is a safe fluid for the space station. 

67
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.320
Water is on the approved list 

68
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.100
of fluids we can send to the station,' he explains. 

69
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.230
'Also, its viscosity is similar to hydrazine, 

70
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.370
a propellant used by satellites; 

71
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.670
and its density is similar to liquid oxygen, 

72
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.030
an important cryogenic propellant.'

73
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.910
During the experiments, 

74
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.670
which can last as long as six hours, 

75
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.920
cameras, gyros and accelerometers 

76
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.480
record the motions of the water.

77
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.960
'We are getting great data,' says Marsell. 

78
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.520
'So far,' he says, 

79
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.940
'our computer models on Earth have done a good job 

80
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.830
predicting wave motions inside the chamber.'

81
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.920
But there is a mystery....

82
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.400
'It has to do with bubbles,' says Schallhorn. 

83
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.740
'The way bubbles form and interact inside the chamber 

84
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.760
is surprising-and not predicted by our models. 

85
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.180
We were taken off guard with what we saw in the data.'

86
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.300
The bubbling and frothing of shaken fuels 

87
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.850
is cutting-edge research in fluid dynamics, 

88
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.320
and SPHERE-Slosh is showing that it may be very important.  

89
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.080
Jacob Roth of the Fluids Group at KSC adds, 

90
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.190
'this is something we plan to investigate further. 

91
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.220
Who knows? 

92
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.000
It might just shake up our understanding of fluids in space.'
